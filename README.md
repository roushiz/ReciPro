# ReciPro
* *ReciPro* makes various crystallographic calculations, simulates diffraction patterns and indexes those.
  * Runs on Windows with .Net Framework 4.8.
  * Now, the author plan to make a manual of Japanese version first and then an English version.
    * Japanese version (under construction): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seto77/ReciPro/master/ReciPro/doc/ReciProManual(ja).pdf
    * English version (under construction): 

## Install
* Access https://github.com/seto77/ReciPro/releases/latest, download *ReciProSetup.msi*, and execute it.

## Main features
* Provides crystallographic calculations.
  * 530 (Hall symbol) space groups are available. 
    * General conditions (or extinction rules), Wyckoff positions, multiplicities of all space groups.  
    * Geometrical calculation of periodicity and/or angle between planes and/or axes.
    * Generation of equivalent atomic positions.

* Includes atomic properties.
  * Characteristic X-ray wavelength/energy.
  * Atomic scattering factor for X-ray, electron and neutron.
  
* Simulates diffraction patterns.
  * X-ray, electron, and neutron sources are available for incident beams.
  * Kinematic simulations for the all sources.
  * Dynamic simulations for electron diffraction based on the Bethe method.
    * Parallel electron diffraction (SAED)
    * Precession electron diffraction (PED)
    * Convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED)
  
* Draws crystal structure using OpenGL4
  * Atom, bonds, polyhedra, unit cell and lattice planes.
  
* Plots stereonet (Wulf-net).
  * Axes and planes of any indices.
  * Large and small circles.
  
* Identifies diffraction spots in the observed image.
  * Major file formats (dm3, dm4, tiff, …) are supported.
  * Automatically detects diffraction spots, and identifies (or indexes) the spots for the selected crystal(s).
  
* Manages crystal data base.
  * ~80 crystal data are initially bundled. 
  * Import/export CIF, AMC format files.
  * Possible to use COD and AMCSD database through CSManager (https://github.com/seto77/CSManager/releases/latest).
